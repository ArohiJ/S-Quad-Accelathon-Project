# S-Quad-Accelathon-Project

Problem Statement:

There are many individuals around us that have an idea in their mind for a start-up, or he /she wants to team up with people of similar interests say for a sport, or even a rock band or wants to open a shop and requires a team to back him/her up. This part where a team is required to be built is difficult at times because we donâ€™t always find people with the similar interest or willing to collaborate.
This project aims to connect users to people who share their interest and help them build a team for their respective domains. Be it sports, a technology start-up, a rock band or any other field that requires a team to be built the user will be able to reach out to people sharing the enthusiasm.
This also provides a platform for the other sector of people, the investors who would like to invest in budding teams.
